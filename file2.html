        <td>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Of all the coding languages, HTML is perhaps the simplest. This is because it doesn't use "dynamic functionality" the way other languages such as Ruby, JavaScript, and PHP can.

        In other words, HTML can't be used to automatically update content on a given website, or provide targeted information, like detecting a user's location to show them the local weather. That being said, its limited abilities don't make HTML any less useful — it remains an essential part of nearly all websites online.</td></tr>

        <td>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
